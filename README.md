# 🪙 BitcoinWallet

**BitcoinWallet** is a multi-language, open-source project focused on building functional Bitcoin wallets in various programming languages. Each wallet supports core Bitcoin features like sending, receiving, managing balances, and transaction history.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this repository is to help developers learn and implement Bitcoin wallet functionality in their preferred language — collaboratively or independently — while adhering to Bitcoin protocol standards.

Each **branch** of this repository represents an implementation in a different **programming language**, allowing for:
- Language-specific best practices
- Cross-language collaboration and learning
- Comparisons in architecture and performance
- Community contributions in familiar ecosystems

## 💼 Core Features to Implement

Each language implementation should aim to support:

- ✅ **Wallet Generation**
  - BIP32/BIP39/BIP44
  - Private/Public Key pairs
  - Mnemonic phrase support

- ✅ **Address Management**
  - Generate P2PKH (and optionally Bech32) addresses
  - QR code generation for receive addresses

- ✅ **Balance Checking**
  - Via APIs like Blockstream, BlockCypher, or Electrum servers

- ✅ **Send Bitcoin**
  - Build and broadcast raw transactions
  - Fee estimation and change address handling

- ✅ **Receive Bitcoin**
  - Display wallet address
  - Monitor incoming transactions

- ✅ **Transaction History**
  - Fetch and display past transactions

- ✅ **Backup & Restore**
  - Encrypted storage
  - Mnemonic/Private key export/import

- ✅ **Security Best Practices**
  - Key encryption
  - Secure storage
  - No private keys sent to external APIs

## 🤝 Contributing
We welcome contributors in all languages! Here's how to get started:

Check out an existing language branch (e.g. python, rust, go)

Or propose a new one (e.g. csharp, kotlin, swift)

Follow the contribution guidelines in that branch

Submit PRs to the appropriate branch only

Each language branch should include:

README.md with setup instructions

Tests (unit/integration)

CLI or UI interface (optional)

📢 We encourage reusable architecture across implementations, but each branch is free to adapt based on the language's strengths and idioms.

## 🛡️ Security Notes
This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes. Do not use it for real funds unless you thoroughly audit the code and understand Bitcoin security principles.

Never expose your private keys or mnemonic phrases.

Use testnet/signet for development and testing.

Encrypt and store sensitive data securely.
