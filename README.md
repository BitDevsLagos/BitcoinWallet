### About

The `BitcoinWallet-Rust` library aims to provide a well-engineered Bitcoin wallet Library in Rust. Our goal is to create a learning resource that adheres to Bitcoin protocol standards and Rust best practices.


### Core Features Roadmap

The following is a list of core features to be implemented, as outlined by the main project goals.

*   [ ] **Wallet Generation**
    *   [ ] BIP39 Mnemonic Phrase Support
    *   [ ] BIP32 Root Key Derivation
    *   [ ] BIP44/84/86 Path Derivation
*   [ ] **Address Management**
    *   [ ] Generate P2PKH, P2WPKH (Bech32) & P2TR (Taproot) addresses
    *   [ ] QR code generation for receive addresses
*   [ ] **Balance Checking**
    *   [ ] Sync wallet state from a blockchain source
*   [  **Send Bitcoin**
    *   [ ]] Coin selection and fee estimation
    *   [ ] Build, sign, and broadcast raw transactions
*   [  **Receive Bitcoin**
    *   [ ]] Display wallet address
    *   [ ] Monitor incoming transactions
*   [ ] **Transaction History**
    *   [ ] Fetch and display past transactions
*   [ ] **Backup & Restore**
    *   [ ] Encrypted wallet file storage
    *   [ ] Restore wallet from mnemonic phrase

### Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This project aims to maintain a **Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)** of `1.70.0`. We will not guarantee that the project compiles on older Rust versions.

### Development

This project uses standard Rust tooling.

*   To build the crate:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```
*   To run all tests:
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```
*   To format the code:
    ```bash
    cargo fmt
    ```

### Contribution

We welcome and encourage contributions! Here’s how you can help:

1.  Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2.  Check out the `Rust-BitcoinWallet` branch: `git checkout Rust-BitcoinWallet`.
3.  Create a new feature branch for your work: `git checkout -b your-feature-name`.
4.  Make your changes. Please add unit tests for new functionality.
5.  Commit your work and push it to your fork.
6.  Open a Pull Request against the `Rust-BitcoinWallet` branch of the main `BitDevsLagos/BitcoinWallet` repository.

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual-licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.

### Project Directory Structure



Of course. Here is a well-structured `README.md` that explains your project structure. This is designed to be placed inside the `rust` branch of the main repository to guide other Rust developers.

# Rust Implementation of BitcoinWallet

This directory contains the Rust implementation of the BitcoinWallet project, structured as a **Cargo Workspace** to ensure a clean separation between core logic and user interfaces.

This approach allows us to build and maintain the critical wallet functionality independently from how the user interacts with it (be it a command-line tool or a graphical interface).

## 🏛️ Project Structure

This project is organized into three distinct crates: `wallet_core`, `cli`, and `gui`.

```

├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
├── cli/

### 🛡️ Security Notes

This project is for **educational and experimental purposes only**. Do not use wallets generated by this software for real funds unless you have thoroughly audited the code and understand the risks involved.

*   **Never expose your private keys or mnemonic phrases.**
*   Use `testnet` or `signet` for all development and testing.
*   Always encrypt and store sensitive data securely.
